# BMI Calculator using OLED and 4x3 Matrix Keypad

To design and implement a **BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator** using the **STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller**, a **4x3 matrix keypad** for user input, and an **OLED display** for output visualization.

---

## üìò Description of the Work
This project focuses on developing an **embedded system** capable of calculating and displaying the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on weight and height inputs provided by the user.

### üîß Hardware Used
- STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller
- 4x3 matrix keypad (for numeric input of weight and height)
- OLED Display (SSD1306 driver, I2C interface)
- ST-Link V2 Debugger
- Jumper Wires

### üíª Software Used
- **STM32CubeIDE** (for code development and flashing)
- **HAL library** for GPIO and I2C handling
- `ssd1306.h`, `ssd1306.c`, `fonts.h`, and `fonts.c` (from OLED lab experiment for OLED handling)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. Upon powering the circuit, the text **‚ÄúBMI Calculator‚Äù** appears on the OLED display.
2. The user is prompted to enter **weight (in kilograms)** and **height (in centimeters)** using the keypad.
3. The microcontroller computes BMI using the standard formula:

   \[
   BMI = \frac{Weight (kg)}{[Height (m)]^2}
   \]

4. The calculated BMI value is displayed on the OLED along with a **health status category**:
   - Underweight
   - Normal
   - Overweight
   - Obese

## üîÅ Program Flow
- Initialization of GPIO pins and OLED communication through I2C.
- Keypad scanning through row-column technique to detect user input.
- Data conversion and computation of BMI.
- OLED output update with the final BMI result and classification.

## ‚úÖ Result
- The system successfully accepts user inputs for **Weight** and **Height** through the 4x3 keypad.
- The OLED display accurately shows the **computed BMI value** and corresponding category.
- The results matched **theoretical BMI calculations**.
- The interface and code were verified and debugged using **STM32CubeIDE** and real hardware testing.
